    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sink your teeth into this: a juicy steak sandwich, piled high with tender slices of beef, caramelised onion, garlic aioli, mustard, lettuce and tomato. Fantastic for a quick midweek meal or for gatherings with family and friends!</p>
<p>I find it ironic that I call this a sandwich because it is about as far as you can get from the ham, lettuce and tomato sandwich that I slapped together to munch on as I was setting up to photograph these Steak Sandwiches. (And yes, I totally see how ridiculous it must seem that I’m munching on a basic sandwich when I have these in front of me but I was hungry, couldn’t wait until I finished shooting, and the last time I rushed photos because I was so starving, I wasn’t happy with them so I had to remake and rephotograph it. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    QUICK GARLIC AIOLI
    <li>3/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1 large garlic clove</li>
    CARAMELISED ONION
    <li>3 large onions</li>
    <li>40 g / 3 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>2 tbsp brown sugar </li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt & pepper</li>
</ul>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Garlic Aioli: Mix mayonnaise and garlic together. Set aside for 30 minutes+ for the flavour to develop (do not keep for more than 3 days tops).</li>
    <li>    Caramelised Onion: Melt butter in a skillet over medium low heat. Add onions and stir to coat in butter. Place lid on (or place a baking tray over skillet) and leave for 20 minutes, stirring once or twice. Remove lid then cook for a further 20 minutes, stirring every now and then, until onion is golden (increase heat slightly if the colour is not changing). Add sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper. Cook for a further 10 minutes until jammy. Remove from heat and keep warm.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <h4>BEEF</h4>
    <li>Take beef out of fridge 20 minutes before cooking. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Transfer beef to a plate, cover loosely with foil and rest for 5 - 10 minutes. Then slice thinly against the grain.</li>
</ol>
